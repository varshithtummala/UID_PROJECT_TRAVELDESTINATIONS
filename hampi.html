                Hampi is an ancient village in the south Indian state of Karnataka.
                 It’s dotted with numerous ruined temple complexes from the Vijayanagara
                  Empire. On the south bank of the River Tungabhadra is the 7th-century 
                  Hindu Virupaksha Temple, near the revived Hampi Bazaar. A carved 
                stone chariot stands in front of the huge Vittala Temple site. Southeast 
                of Hampi, Daroji Bear Sanctuary is home to the Indian sloth bear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hampi is famous for its ruins belonging to the erstwhile medieval
                 Hindu kingdom of Vijaynagar and it is declared a World Heritage site.
                 The temples of Hampi, its monolithic sculptures and monuments, attract the
                  traveler because of their excellent workmanship.

                <P>
                    The temple is so constructed that its main entrance faces east and homes to two courtyards.
                     No sooner you enter the temple, there is a statue of Nandi with three heads. There is a pillared
                     hall in the center which is reckoned as the Ranga Mandapa.

In case you are an international traveler, you have to register yourself at a police outpost with all 
your essential details. Mostly, this temple remains crowded in December; whereas it celebrates its annual 
festival in February and it is one of the best places to visit in Hampi.

                        Hubli is the nearest airport (about 160km) west of Hampi. Further northwest is Belgaum airport (about 270 km from Hampi). Both has moderate connections with cities around the region.

Jindal Vijaynagar Airport (Code : VDY ) near Hospet is a small airport with connection to Bangalore and Hyderabad. Needs to arrange own cab pickup, as public transport to Hampi from the airport is limited.

A more practical option is to fly to Bangalore and take the overnight Hampi Express .</p>
