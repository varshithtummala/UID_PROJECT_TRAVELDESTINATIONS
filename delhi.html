                <p><b>Red Fort</b></p>
                <p>Constructed in 1639 by the Mughals, Red Fort gets its name from its massive red-coloured 
                    sandstone walls. Set in Old Delhi, the octagonal-shaped fort is spread over an area of 254 
                    acres. The planning and designing of the fort is a fusion of Mughal, Persian, Hindu, and 
                    
                    Timurid traditions. A strong influence on later structures built in and around Delhi, 
                    Red Fort also features a museum that holds Mughal-era artefacts, including daggers, 
                    curtains, miniature paintings and carpets. The highlights of this architectural creativity 
                    include the peacock throne, step well, imperial bath, Moti Masjid and Hira Mahal.</p>

                     battling against the foreign army during the World War I. Designed by Edwin Lutyens,

                         Standing on a Bharatpur stone base, the structure is surrounded by lush lawns making
