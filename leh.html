                Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory, 
            and constitutes a part of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of dispute between India,
            Pakistan, and China since 1947.It was established on 31 October 2019, 
            following the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. 
            Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, 
            the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south, 
            both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered 
            Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass 
            in the far north. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main 
            Great Himalayas to the south. The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, 
            is claimed by the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, and has been under Chinese control since 1962.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of 
                important trade routes, but as the Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet
                Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the 1960s, international trade dwindled. Since 1974, the Government
                of India has successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. As Ladakh is a part of the strategically important
                Kashmir region, the Indian military maintains a strong presence in the region.

                    Its inhabited areas form a tri-armed valley cut by the Nubra and Shyok rivers. 
                    Its Tibetan name Ldumra means "the valley of flowers". 
                    Demands have been raised and Administration has hinted at creation of Nubra as a new district.
                    Diskit, the headquarters of Nubra, is about 150 km north from Leh, the capital of Ladakh
