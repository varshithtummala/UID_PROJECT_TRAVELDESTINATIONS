            <p>
                Rishikesh is a city in India’s northern state of Uttarakhand,
                 in the Himalayan foothills beside the Ganges River. The river is considered holy, 
                 and the city is renowned as a center for studying yoga and meditation. Temples and ashrams (centers for spiritual studies) line the 
                eastern bank around Swarg Ashram, a traffic-free, alcohol-free and vegetarian enclave upstream from Rishikesh town.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rishikesh is primarily famous for its spiritual importance. There are a number of Yoga Ashramas 
                for practicing meditation. Rishikesh is the beginning of the famous Char Dham Yatra (Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath).

                <p><b> Laxman Jhula</b></p>
                <P>
                    One of the most prominent places in Rishikesh, Laxman Jhula is a 450-feet long suspension bridge 
                    at the height of 70 feet from the river. Built in the year 1939, the bridge is an important attraction 
                    as it is believed that it is the same place where Lord Laxman crossed the Ganga River on a jute rope.

While you will find plenty of cafes on both sides of the bridge, the famous places you should definitely 
visit are Laxman Temple and Tera Manzil Mandir situated close by.

When crossing the bridge, do stop in the middle and just soak in the view of the hills all a
round you. Nothing is more surreal than this!

                <p><b> Ram Jhula</b></p>
                <p>
                    A few miles downstream from Laxman Jhula is the Ram Jhula. Almost similar in its structure
                     and construction, this suspension bridge was built in 1980, a little later than Laxman Jhula.

                    As you cross this bridge, you will witness the Himalayas peeking out of clouds on clear days and the Ganga
                    River gushing down in full flow. It does make for a scenic vista which you don’t want to miss when in Rishikesh.


                    The bridge is also renowned for linking two popular ashrams of the town – Swarg Ashram on one end and
                    the Sivananda Ashram on the other. About 450 feet long, this bridge offers breath-taking views of valleys
                    and the temples around. Walk slowly if you want to take it all in.

                    Also known as Trimbakeshwar Temple, this is one of the most renowned temples of Rishikesh.
                     Perched on the banks of River Ganga, the temple (as its name suggests) has 13 storeys
                     and a strikingly beautiful architecture. It can be easily distinguished from afar thanks to its colourful facade.</p>

                    It is one of the most famous ghats in Rishikesh and makes for a beautiful place to watch the evening Ganga Aarti. The sanctity of the Ghat
                     comes from the legend that it sees the confluence of three major rivers – Ganga, 
                      and Saraswati.The ghat is considered sacred and if Hindu mythology is to be believed, it is
                       said that a dip in the holy water of Ganga near the ghat can purge all your sins. 
                     After all, this ghat has been mentioned in both our epics – Ramayana and Mahabharata.

                    Note: Try and leave Delhi between 4-5 a.m as driving time increases beyond 6 hours due to morning congestion in towns like Modinagar and Roorkee.

                The best time to visit Varanasi is during the winter months (November to February). Although it gets fairly cold during the winters,
                 this is the best time when you can explore the holy city without getting tired. The average low temperature is around 5°C.
