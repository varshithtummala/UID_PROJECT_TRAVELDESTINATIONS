            <p>
                Manali is a high-altitude Himalayan resort town in India’s northern Himachal Pradesh 
                state. It has a reputation as a backpacking center and honeymoon destination. Set on the Beas River,
                 it’s a gateway for skiing in the Solang Valley and trekking in Parvati Valley. It's also a jumping-
                off point for paragliding, rafting and mountaineering in the Pir Panjal mountains, home to 4,000m-high Rohtang Pass.
            </p>

            <p>
                The British introduced apple trees in the area; the first apple orchard was set up near Patlikuhal.
                 Currently, apples along with plums and pears account for the bulk of the agriculture-dominated economy
                  of the town. The British colonial
                 administration also introduced rainbow and brown trouts into the rivers and streams of the area.[citation needed]

                <P>
                    Also known by the names Hidimba Devi Temple and Dhungari Temple, this ancient
                     shrine was built by Maharaja Bahadur Singh way back in 1553. As the name suggests, 
                     the temple is dedicated to Hidimba Devi, wife of Bheema. The wooden architecture of th
                     e shrine is very distinct from most Hindu temples you will come across in the country. 
                     There’s another shrine dedicated to Hidimba Devi’ son Ghatotkacha in the premises. Surrounded 
                     by thick cedar groves and with snow
                    -capped mountains serving as the backdrop, the temple is one of the best places to visit in Manali.

                <p>
                    A mini valley located at about 8400 feet above sea level, Solang Nala is a short drive
                     away from Manali. It is a haven for adventure and sports lovers and while here, you can 
                     try your skills on a pair of skis or go for a snowmobile exploration. When the weather warms
                      up, people flock here for zorbing and paragliding. You can also hop onto a cable car and enjoy 
                      mesmerizing views of the Himalayas. If you are looking for snow-based activities and sports,
                     winters are the best time to visit while the months of summer are ideal for other adventure sports.

                    The rushing cascades of Jogini Falls are a short and invigorating trek away from 
                    the main town of Manali. The trail that leads to the waterfall is scenic and gives you 
                    a glimpse of the River Beas and the snow-capped peaks of Rohtang. Apart from the serene setting,
                     Jogini is also an important place of pilgrimage and you can visit many old shrines around the pool at the bottom.
                      An early start is recommended so that you
                     can spend more time at this picturesque natural spot, which is one of the top trekking as well as picnic places in Manali.
