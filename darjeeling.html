                Darjeeling is a town in India's West Bengal state, in the Himalayan foothills.
                 Once a summer resort for the British Raj elite, it remains the terminus of the
                  narrow-gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, or “Toy Train,” completed in 1881. It's 
                  famed for the distinctive black tea grown on plantations that dot its surrounding slopes. 
                  Its backdrop is Mt. Kanchenjunga, among the world’s highest peaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Snowfall is rarely seen in Darjeeling. But sometimes, the temperature can drop down to -2 degree 
                Celsius, so make sure you pack some woollens. July to September: Starting July
                 till August, heavy rainfall is observed in Darjeeling.

                    The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway also referred to as the DHR,
                     and lovingly called the 'Darjeeling Toy Train', is a 2 feet narrow gauge train that runs 
                     between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling, in West Bengal, India. The construction of this 88-kilometre
                     long railway line took place between 1879 and 1881, and a ride on this train route has been a coveted 
                     experience ever since.

                    Lying at an altitude of 2590 meters and a distance of 13 kilometres
                    away from the Darjeeling, Tiger Hill is most famous for its splendid sights of sunrise
                     from where you can see the peaks of Kanchenjunga illuminate before the sun is seen at 
                     lower elevations. The magnificent view of snow-capped mountains sitting amidst cotton 
                     clouds attracts tourists to Tiger Hill from all over the country. Interestingly, 
                    this is also the summit of Ghoom, which is the highest railway station in the Darjeeling 
                    Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                    Perhaps one of the most picturesque train routes in all of Darjeeling, the Batasia
                     Loop is a lush green toy train pathway that is meant to minimise the elevation of 
                     the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The unique design of this magnificent attraction
                      allows the track to wrap around itself through a hilltop tunnel. One of the most 
                      enchanting aspects of the Batasia Loop is its unmatched natural beauty which is a 
                      wonderful sight to behold. Located on Hill Cart Road (NH 55), you can enjoy a panoramic
                       view of the Darjeeling in all its verdant glory.
