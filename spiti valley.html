                    at an altitude of about 4300 m in the mighty Himalayas. The stunning lake is situated 
                    on the Samudra Tapu plateau in the Lahaul region of the Lahaul and Spiti district and 
                    is the source of the Chandra River. The name "Chandra Taal" (Lake of the Moon) comes 
                    from its crescent shape. This lake is also one of two high-altitude wetlands of India 
                    that have been designated as Ramsar sites.
