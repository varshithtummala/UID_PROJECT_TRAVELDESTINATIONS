                Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal
                 family that once ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is 
                 now called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark building color.
                  At the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) 
                stands the opulent, colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens,
                 courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence.
            </p>

                Jaipur, popularly known as the Pink City of India, is the
                 largest city in the state of Rajasthan. It is also the capital of Rajasthan. 
                Known for Hawa Mahal, Jal Mahal, Amer Fort, Jantar Mantar and
                 several other places to visit, Jaipur has numerous stories to tell.

                <P>
                    City Palace has stood at the heart of the Old City of Jaipur for nearly
                     three centuries, shortly after Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh 
                    II decided to relocate his court from the city of Amber. Protected by huge 
                    guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's
                     modern-day royal family, and is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine.

City Palace is more than a sand-colored regal abode—it's a sprawling complex of buildings built 
around a series of landscaped garden courtyards overlooking Jaipur and Lake Palace.
 The entire property is a stunning display of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture.

                <p>
                    At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-
                    than-life abstract sculptures. But this is not an art gallery—it's a 
                    special collection of astronomical tools started by Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.

Each of the 20 or so structures at the UNESCO World Heritage Site serves a distinctive purpose. 
The observatory's massive sun dial, known as Samrat Yantra, is particularly striking. At 27 meters
 tall, it casts a huge shadow that accurately measures time down to two seconds.

                    If you had any preconceived notions about how the buildings in Jaipur look, 
                    they probably came from Hawa Mahal (Palace of Breeze). It has all of the distinctive
                     architectural features that appear in postcards of the city, from the salmon-pink,
                      honeycombed facade, built to resemble the crown of Hindu god Krishna, to the geometric a
                      ccents and rows of tiny windows.

The landmark was built in 1799 to allow royal ladies to watch festivals on the street without being seen by 
the public. Its 953 windows allow plenty of breeze to pass through, making it an ideal summer palace.

                <p><b>Amber Fort</b></p>
                <p>
                    Jaipur is home to one of India's most-visited forts: Amber Fort. Built in the year 1592, 
                    the sandstone and marble monolith stands atop a small hill roughly 20 minute's driving 
                    distance northeast of the center of Jaipur. It's best known for being a pristine example 
                    of Rajasthani architecture.

Getting to Amber Fort typically involves a short uphill hike that's well worth the effort. It's decked out with 
intricate patterns of inlaid marble in nearly every color of the rainbow. The fort is laid out into four separate 
sections, each of which has a spectacular garden courtyard outside. While you'd never know it from above, you can
 actually explore the fort's underground tunnels, some of which have been restored.
