                 seat of the former ruling Wodeyar dynasty. The palace blends Hindu,
                 Islamic, Gothic and Rajput styles. Mysore is also home to the centuries-old Devaraja
                  Market, filled with spices, silk and sandalwood.

                        might and beauty of Lord Krishna (Chenna= Beautiful and Kesava= Krishna).
