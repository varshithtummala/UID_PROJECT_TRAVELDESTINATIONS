                September to March are the best months to visit Sundarbans, the winters being the most
                 pleasant period in the area. Summers could be quite hot and send the temperature 
                 shooting up, but are an ideal time to visit the wildlife sanctuary. The monsoons with
                  full generosity in showers may make travelling a little difficult but the lush green
                   surroundings might just make up for it. Aside from spotting these majestic beasts
                    in their natural habitat, Sundarban National Park also has an abundance of diverse
                     flora and fauna that make visiting the attraction worth it.
