                <P>The definitive top attraction in Amritsar is the Golden Temple, a two-story structure covered 
                    in real gold and surrounded by a 5.1-meter-deep manmade lake. But not merely a tourist site, 
                    this legendary religious shrine is one of the most sacred places in the world for Sikhs, many of
                     whom make a pilgrimage to the temple at least once in their lifetimes.

                    border of Pakistan, where a curious border-closing ceremony takes place at sunset 
                    every afternoon. Full of pomp and circumstance, the Beating Retreat Ceremony involves an
                    ostentatious display of goose-stepping guards from the Indian Border Security Force and 
                    the Pakistan Rangers saluting each other, lowering and folding their flags, and closing 
                    the gates at the border.</p>

                <p>The year 1947 was a big one for India. Not only was it the year that India gained its
                    independence from Great Britain, it was also the year it split into the two different entities 
                    of India and Pakistan—an event known as the Partition of India.
                    Tourists in Amritsar can learn about this defining moment in history at the Partition
                     Museum, the only institution in the world devoted entirely to Partition.</p>

                    Jallianwala Bagh. The public garden memorializes the estimated 1,500 people who were 
                    killed or injured when British soldiers were ordered to fire on peaceful protesters who were 
                    demanding the release of imprisoned leaders of the Indian Independence Movement in 1919. 
                    You can still see bullet holes in the walls that hundreds of victims hid behind in attempt to dodge the gunfire
                    .</p>

                 time temperature is between 15 to 30 Degree Celsius. Ladakh is known for its extremely low temperatures 
                 almost all through the year. While it is quite pleasant in the summer time, the winters are exceedingly
