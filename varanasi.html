            <p>
                varanasi is a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh dating to the 11th 
                century B.C. Regarded as the spiritual capital of India, the city draws Hindu pilgrims who 
                bathe in the Ganges River’s sacred waters and perform funeral rites. Along the city's
                 winding streets are some 2,000 temples, including Kashi Vishwanath, the “Golden Temple,” 
                 dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva
            </p>
            <p>
                Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes,
                 ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism
                 here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath.

                <P>
                    Named after the Hindu goddess Ganga, the Ganges River is one of the most revered natural
                     sites in India. The river extends southeast from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of 
                     Bengal. Between 400 million and 600 million people rely on the Ganges River to provide water
                      for daily bathing and drinking.

                    Hindus come to Varanasi from all around the world to purify themselves in the holy Ganges
                     water and perform rituals along the dozens of ghats along the river. For tourists, the river 
                     helps provide a fixed point of orientation for navigating around the city, and you'll no doubt 
                     spend lots of time sightseeing and watching life happen around the Ganges.

                <p>
                    The lively atmosphere of the Dasaswamedh Ghat makes it one of the best places to visit in Varanasi.
                     This tourist attraction is a swirling hodgepodge of flower sellers touting bright blossoms, boat 
                     operators hawking rides along the Ganges River, and sadhus (holy men) with face paint. You can 
                     spend hours people watching in this area during the day.

Hindu priests put on the Ganga Aarti every night at the Dasaswamedh Ghat, starting at around 7pm. Donning
 saffron-hued robes, the priests spread out plates of flower petals and other offerings and blow a 
 conch shell to signal the start of the spiritual ceremony.

                <p><b> Assi Ghat</b></p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to famous places in Varanasi, the city's southernmost main ghat regularly tops 
                    the list. Assi Ghat's star attraction is a Shiva lingam (phallic representation of the Hindu deity) beneath a
                     sacred fig tree. It draws hundreds of pilgrims every day, who come to worship Lord Shiva after rinsing in the Ganges River.

Feeling a little stiff from traveling? Swing by Assi Ghat at sunrise, when you can get your downward-facing dog on 
with dozens of others during morning yoga accompanied by live music every day. Tourists can also see 
another Ganga Aarti performance here in the evening, which is slightly smaller and more intimate than the one at Dasaswamedh Ghat.

                <p>
                    Plumes of smoke swirl toward the sky at Manikarnika Ghat. No, it's not from a 
                    factory — it's from the perpetual cremations that happen on this ghat. Hindus believe that Manikarnika Ghat is one 
                    of the most auspicious places for the departed to reach moksha (emancipation from the cycle of spiritual rebirth).
                     The funeral pyre at this ghat burns 24/7, and around 100 cremations take place every day.

                    Priests or guides frequently offer to lead tourists through the fascinating ghat,
                     however some can be aggressive in their demands for money.
