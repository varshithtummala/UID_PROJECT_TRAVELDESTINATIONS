                        apital city; Panaji. As the tourist season arrives, this aerodrome also receives international flights 
                        even though it is mainly served by domestic airlines. The airport also provides currency exchange, prepaid
                        taxi counter and ATMs along with the basic amenities. To keep you busy as you await your flight

                         to the north and Mangalore to the south. However, Margao’s Madgaon Railway Station is 
                         the biggest station and strongly linked to other parts of the country through a vast train 
                         network. Regular trains run from Delhi to Madgaon, the important ones being Goa Sampark Kranti E
                         xpress and Trivandrum Express.

                        However, the central pick up or drop-off points are located in Panaji, Margao
                         and Mapusa. If you plan to travel between North and South Goa, you will have to 
                         change buses at either Margao or Panaji. Fares start from INR 5 to INR 40. 
                         Local buses are usually rusty and stop at many places, hence try to take the faster 
                         ‘express’ buses instead.
