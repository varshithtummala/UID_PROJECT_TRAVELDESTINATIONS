            <p>
                The Andaman Islands are an Indian archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. 
                These roughly 300 islands are known for their palm-lined, white-sand
                 beaches, mangroves and tropical rainforests. Coral reefs supporting 
                 marine life such as sharks and rays make for popular diving and 
                 snorkeling sites. Indigenous Andaman Islanders inhabit the more 
                 remote islands, many of which are off limits to visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a very low crime rate, Andaman is extremely safe and peaceful. Also,
                 there have been no reports of communal violence. Tourist's best time visiting
                  the Andaman Islands have never faced any kind of safety issue. If you have 
                  any questions regarding Andaman safety, you can always reach us.
                  Andaman can be fairly expensive to travel because there are lesser number
                  of cabs and no Uber or Ola is present here currently. The only way to travel
                   is by either public transportation or pre-booked cabs. Although publi
                   c transportation is relatively cheaper, it can be a hassle to keep track of timings.

                <P>
                    The North Bay Island gives an intensive feel of summer and sand. The corals at North
                     Bay are exquisite and are spread through a long coast line in an extensive stretch.
                      Dive a bit to catch some glimpses of lobsters, clown fish families, stone fish staring
                       at you from behind the corals. The experience is a rightful mix of thrill and fun for
                       all divers, especially the first timers.
                       The natural beauty of North Bay Island is beyond par. The light house peeping from 
                       above the verdant greenery has found a place in the 20 rupee note of Indian currency
                        not for nothing. The alluring charm of this destination is indeed special.

                <p>
                    This exotic island is famous for its exquisite secluded beaches, mangrove creeks, mud
                     volcanoes and limestone caves — each of which is unique and worth a visit. 
                     The experience of the mud volcanoes and limestone cave is so enigmatic that
                      it is worth a peep for the adventurous and brave at heart. Guides are provided
                       and permission needs to be secured from the Andaman Forest Department for limestone cave exploration.

               Nilambur Jetty of Baratang Island has boats to Nayadera Jetty through wide creeks for about one 
                         and half hours and after that the caves are one and half kilometre walk away through tropical 
                        forests. To reach Baratang Island’s hidden natural jewels, one has to pass through the tribal
                      inhabitations of Andamans.

                <p>
                    Havelock Island is one of the primary destinations of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
                     It is famed for its pristine beauty that goes unmatched when it comes to 
                     untouched and unexplored natural beauty and virgin forests of earth.
                      It is a striking contrast of verdant greenery, sandy whiteness and blue vast
                      ocean body. Due to its more than fair share of popularity among tourists and 
                      travelers, Havelock has developed luxurious tourist resorts and hotels to pamper 
                      the guests living in the lap of intense natural beauty. Havelock is the largest 
                      of islands and falls under must-visit destinations. A tour to Andamans would 
                      definitely be incomplete without a visit to the Elephant Beach and Radhanagar
                      Beach of Havelock Island.
